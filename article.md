# T-Mobile Austria Is OK With Storing Passwords Partly in Clear Text

I chose to write my reflection on this article as it was something that definitely
gave me whiplash when I first heard about it in early 2018. At the time, I was
fairly new to Computer Science, with just under a year of experience, and learning
how to create full-stack web applications. When I learned that T-Mobile's Austrian
division stored passwords in plain-text format, I was gobsmacked.

Revisiting this situation through an ethics lens poses the question: do tech
companies have an obligation to protect your data to the fullest extent they can?

Focusing on the first part of the ethical dilemma, I believe that tech
companies *do* have an obligation to protect your sensitive data. For a moment,
consider a local fruit stand and its customers. Customers can, at a glance,
determine which fruits are rotting, may last longer, would be sweet vs. sour.
Customers shop under the 'buyer beware' premise that they are responsible
(to an extent) for the quality of their purchases. However, this 'buyer-beware'
mindset can't be easily applied to commercialized tech companies. Not every
T-Mobile can understand how their mobile network works, how reliable it is, and
how many outages to expect per-year. Since customers ultimately have to rely on
the good faith on the company to produce a quality product, tech companies do
have an obligation, and even an incentive, to ensure that their product keeps
the customer's best interest at heart. In this case, T-mobile should be protecting
their customers' sensitive data.

Ethics is, of course, a Socratic field where questions beget questions and
unfortunately, the phrase, "to the fullest extent," opens a can of
worms. The second part of the ethical dilemma at hands forces to attempt to answer the question of "what exactly is the fullest extent?". While I can't necessarily
give a well-rounded enough answer besides "the best they can," the following
questions pop in my head and can help define what the fullest extent may be:

- Are companies expected to keep with the latest, stable cryptographic functions
and hashing?
- Should the company force its employees to have good password health for internal
tools? Good password health can range anywhere from creating a strong password
with different symbols and characters to regularly changing passwords (even on
a weekly basis).
  - Should good password health also be an external requirement for employees?
- How does the "fullest extent" work in terms of social engineering and phishing
attacks?
- In the case of a data breach, should the company be forced to close since they
couldn't adequately protect sensitive customer data?
- What happens in the face of quantum computing where cryptography may become
obsolete?
